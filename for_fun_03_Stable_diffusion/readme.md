## Overview

Stable Diffusion is a state-of-the-art generative model designed to create high-quality images from text prompts, transform one image into another, and perform inpainting. This project not only provides the full implementation but also breaks down the mathematics and theory behind each component.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this project, it's essential to have a foundational understanding of the following concepts:
1. **Transformer Models**: Familiarity with transformers is crucial. We recommend the following resource for a detailed explanation: [Attention is all you need (Transformer Explanation)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIiWuClvH54).

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/anuragsingh17ai/Stable-Diffusion.git
    cd Stable-Diffusion
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure you have the correct environment setup for running the models (e.g., CUDA for GPU support).

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `models/`: Contains the model definitions for VAE, CLIP, Unet, and others.
- `data/`: Scripts and tools for handling datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step explanations and visualizations.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for training, evaluation, and inference.
- `slides/`: PDF slides with theoretical explanations and visual aids.

## Core Components

### Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

The Variational Autoencoder is a type of generative model that learns to encode data into a latent space and decode it back into the original data. In the context of Stable Diffusion, the VAE is used to encode images into a latent representation that the model can manipulate.

### CLIP

Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) is a model developed by OpenAI that learns to connect text and images. CLIP is used in Stable Diffusion to interpret and embed text prompts, allowing the model to generate images that match the given textual descriptions.

### Unet

The Unet architecture is a type of convolutional neural network that is particularly well-suited for image segmentation tasks. In Stable Diffusion, Unet is employed to predict the noise added to the images during the diffusion process, making it a crucial part of the denoising mechanism.

### Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)

DDPM is a generative model that learns to generate data by reversing a gradual noising process. It consists of a forward process that gradually adds noise to the data and a reverse process that removes the noise to generate new data. DDPM is the backbone of the Stable Diffusion model.

### Scheduler

The scheduler manages the noise levels and guides the model through the denoising process. It ensures that the noise is added and removed in a structured manner, enabling the generation of coherent and high-quality images.

## Usage

To use the Stable Diffusion model, follow these steps:

1. **Training**: Use the provided scripts to train the model on your dataset.
    ```bash
    python scripts/train.py --config configs/stable_diffusion.yaml
    ```

2. **Inference**: Generate images using a trained model.
    ```bash
    python scripts/inference.py --model_path checkpoints/stable_diffusion.pth --prompt "A beautiful landscape"
    ```

3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model.
    ```bash
    python scripts/evaluate.py --model_path checkpoints/stable_diffusion.pth --dataset_path data/evaluation_set
    ```
